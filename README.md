# maze-visualizer
It's a homework of Artificial Intelligence course in Spring 2024 at Sharif University of Technology. It's about implementing some search algorithms such as A*. I designed this homework as a TA (Teacher Assistant) for students.

You can see the question and its answer in the repository. First you need to run the answer file and then upload the exported files to the [website](https://project.amfakhimi.com/maze-visualizer). There are some samples of the exported files in `samples` folder. You can upload them into the website to try it. You can also design your desired map in the website, export it, and then load it into the answer file.

Some pictures of visualized algorithms:
